      <p>Welcome to the Young Agrarians Resource Map. Use the ADD RESOURCE button to add your listing.</p>

      <p>We are focused on mapping resources relevant to agro-ecology, which we translate to mean: ecological agriculture, or certified or uncertified organic food production. Our sector is small, which is why we are focused on growing it, and supporting new entrants into agriculture to see what resources are out there.</p>

      <h4>U-MAP</h4>

      <p>
        Click the ADD RESOURCE button. Fill out the form to upload your listing. We will approve it before it goes live.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please test your location address in google maps to make sure it is locatable.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your resource does not have an address, it will still appear in the Results Listings below the map.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are an organization that is mapping Resources in your area, and you would like to share data with Young Agrarians, please contact: <a href="mailto:theyoungagrarians@gmail.com">theyoungagrarians@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you would like to volunteer to help us grow the map, please email us. We would love your help.
      </p>

      <h4>SEARCH THE MAP</h4>

      <p>
        You can use the drop down menus beside the map to:
      </p>

      <p>
        Pick a province (default setting British Columbia)
      </p>
      <p>
        Pick a BioRegion (currently for British Columbia only)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Legend allows you to pick Categories and
        The <i class="icon-expand-alt"></i> sign under the Category allows you to select Sub-Categories
        You can close the Sub-Categories using the <i class="icon-collapse-alt"></i> sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you select a Category or Sub-Category it will show up as an icon on the map (if it has a physical address) and a Results
        Listing below the map. When you select an icon on the map it will show you a pop-up window with more information. Click on the
        Listing’s name to be taken to that Listing’s website, where available.
      </p>
